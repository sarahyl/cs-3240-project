# Schedule Advisor Website

This is a website where students can login through Google accounts to search courses and create schedules, then submit schedules to advisor users for review and approval. Advisors also log in through Google accounts and can approve or reject their students' schedules. This allows for students to quickly put together a course schedule and get it approved by their advisor with just a click of a button. On the advisor view, the website puts all of the pending review requests in one location, decreasing the chance of a student's review request to get lost in an advisor's email inbox.
